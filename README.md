This study investigates the cross-regional transferability of remote sensing–based aboveground biomass (AGB) models in subtropical forests under strong spatial heterogeneity. We first developed and evaluated machine-learning biomass models in a source region (Xijiang Forest Farm, Guangdong, China) using GEDI L4A footprint AGBD as the primary training target and field inventory plots as independent validation. We then assessed model transferability to a geographically distinct target region (Simao District, Pu’er, Yunnan, China) through three transfer strategies: direct transfer, fine-tuning, and full retraining. Wall-to-wall AGB maps were generated and compared against an independent biomass product (ESA CCI Biomass) for spatial consistency.
